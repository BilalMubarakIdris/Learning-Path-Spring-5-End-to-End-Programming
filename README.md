# Learning Path - Spring 5 End-to-End Programming

When it comes to developing applications for the web or enterprises, the Spring Framework has become one of the most popular choices among Java developers. With an array of tools and features, Spring offers developers experience that is rivaled by none.

Spring 5: End-to-End Programming is all about leveraging these features and developing your own business applications with hands-on examples. You will create applications of increasing complexity, such as a CMS app, a messaging app, and a real-world microservice.

While developing these applications, you will learn about Project Reactor in Spring, Spring Webflux, Spring Data, and Angular. You will also develop these applications using standard design patterns in Spring, helping you to solve common design problems with ease.
